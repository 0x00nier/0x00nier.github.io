# PersistenceisFutile — Forensic Challenge — HackTheBox Write-up

In this article, we will explore how to solve the Forensic Challenge called PersistenceisFutile present within HackTheBox. Credits to @0xdf for making this. This was rated “Medium” on the platform, but personally, I think some sub-sections of this challenge were not so medium. After solving this challenge, I saw that there was no proper write-up for this challenge and thus, for that reason I am writing this. I think this challenge is a great example of Incident Response.

With that said, let’s see the challenge itself first.

![](./img/chal.webp)

According to this prompt, we have SSH access and sudo rights as user “user”. Let’s SSH into the instance then.

![](./img/ssh.webp)

After SSHing in successfully, we see a long hostname. I instantly knew that this was a Docker container. But fortunately for us, that fact has no bearing on the challenge itself.

> Note — There are 8 backdoors and I do not know the order for them. But I'll write this the way I did it in one go.

![](./img/home.webp)

On running `ll` the current directory, we immediately see something pop out right away. It should be obvious that this should be deleted and we do so with `rm -rf .backdoor`.

I also took a look at `.bashrc` and found this -

![](./img/bashrc.webp)

This is clearly a reverse shell. This might be unknown to some people, but to completely remediate a reverse shell situation, you have to also delete the `/dev/tcp/[IP]/[Port]` file as well. We do this by `rm -rf /dev/tcp/172.17.0.1/443`. I immediately remove this alias.

Since I found this, I thought to check the root folder as well. On opening `.bashrc` we see this.

![](./img/rootbashrc.webp)

We remove this line as well and delete `alertd` as shown below

![](./img/deletealertd.webp)

My next step was to see what processes are running. I did so with `ps auxef` and you can see the output below.

![](./img/psaux.webp)

Right away, we again see that something suspicious called `connectivity-check` is running using bash. We kill this using `kill -9 18` (the PID for you might be different). Make sure to kill the process that’s the least indented first and then the other remaining ones.

![](./img/concheck.webp)

On opening the file we see the above. We also delete `connectivity-check` then.

Usually after checking for processes, I also check for SUID binaries (as part of my PrivEsc methodology. I do this by `find / -perm -04000 2>/dev/null`

![](./img/findsuid.webp)

Immediately we see some suspicious-looking binaries. We delete all these binaries using `rm -rf`

Now, what I also like to do is run a tool called `PsPy`. It basically monitors processes and see if any new ones pop up.

We transfer the tool (64 bit version) using scp to /home/user.

![](./img/pspy.webp)

On running `PsPy`, we see `alertd` pop up.

We run `ps auxef` again to check for `alertd` and we find it running.

![](./img/psauxef.webp)

Then, I decided to check the cron files. I checked the crontab for root and there was nothing suspicious there. Then I also checked for the cron for user and found this.

![](./img/cron.webp)

This probably digs up the `TXT` record from `imf0rce.HTB` and run whatever is on it using `sh`. The file for crontab is stored in `/var/spool/cron/crontabs` as user. We delete this file as well. I decided to check other cron files as well in `/etc`.

![](./img/findcron.webp)

We see two files that are normally not there.

## Let's look at pyssh first

![](./img/pyssh.webp)

There is a `dist-package` in the `python3` directories called `ssh_import_id_update` which I thought looked suspicious.

![](./img/distpack.webp)

It seems that this file basically adds a key to some path. We base64 decode the commands and get the following.

![](./img/auth.webp)

Seeing this, I then check `authorized_keys` in `.ssh` of root and remove this particular key.

## Now let’s look at access-up

![](./img/acessup.webp)

So, it seems that `bash` is copied into `bin` or `sbin` with some random letters via `tr` and `/dev/urandom`. We see that the permissions set were 4755 and so we search for files with that permission with `find`.

![](./img/suid.webp)

As we can see, there is no random lettered binaries running here because we already removed them (`dlxcrw` and others). Finally, we remove both `access-up` and `pyssh.

Then I remembered that `connectivity-check` was also running automatically somehow. I didn’t find anything in the cron files for sure. So I decided to look for any file that has the substring `connectivity-check` using `find / -type f -name “*connectivity-check*” 2>/dev/null`. Sure enough, I found something I had not found before.

![](./img/concheck2.webp)

![](./img/concheck3.webp)

On opening the file we can see that it runs a `nohup` on `connectivity-check`. We immediately delete this file as well.

Then as `root`, I thought to check the `/etc/shadow` and `/etc/passwd` files. I found something odd in `/etc/passwd`.

![](./img/passwd.webp)

If you look closely here, it seems that `/bin/bash` is in the line for `gnats`. But `gnats` is not a user like `user` or `root` so this was suspicious. Furthermore, it seems that `gnats` is in the `root` group (as indicated by the text “41:0”) . Thus, we change `/bin/bash` to `/usr/sbin/nologin` and change the 0 to 41.

![](./img/shadow.webp)

On opening `/etc/shadow`, we clearly see a hash associated with gnats which simply means that `gnats` is registered as a user.

![](./img/shadowedited.webp)

Thus, we remove the hash and make it into an account like the others above it.

I decided to check the `solveme` binary in root and saw the flag.

![](./img/solvme.webp)

I really liked this challenge and learnt a lot. This was my first write-up and I hope you learnt something.
